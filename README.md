» During this program, I performed various tasks that helped me learn essential skills required for data analysis and data visualization using Power BI in a meaningful manner.


 ## ✨ TASK 1 : Call Centre Analysis
 
► As a part of the PwC Switzerland Virtual Internship Program offered by Forage, I have created a "Call Center Analysis" Dashboard, using Power BI. This dataset containing call records from a customer service center. Each row represents a call with various attributes such as Call Id, Agent, Date, Time, Topic, whether it was Answered (Yes/No), Resolved, Speed of answer in seconds, and Average Talk Duration. 

### ➡️ Objective:
 » The objective of the dashboard is to deliver meaningful insights and actionable information to empower the Call Centre. 

 » Overall customer satisfaction: This KPI measures the satisfaction level of customers who contacted the call center for support.
 
 » Overall calls answered/abandoned: This KPI measures the number of calls answered by agents versus the number of calls abandoned by customers.
 
 » Calls by time: This KPI measures the volume of calls during different times of the day, week, or month.
 
 » Average speed of answer: This KPI measures the average time taken by agents to answer customer calls.
 
 » Agent’s performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered: This KPI measures the performance of agents in terms of the average handle time of calls versus the number of calls answered.

 ## ✨ TASK 2 : Customer Churn Analysis

» As a part of the PwC Switzerland Virtual Internship Program offered by Forage, I have created a "𝐂𝐮𝐬𝐭𝐨𝐦𝐞𝐫 𝐂𝐡𝐮𝐫𝐧 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬" Dashboard, using Power BI.

### ➡️ Objective :

The Telecommunications Retention Manager is actively seeking a comprehensive solution to elevate customer retention efforts and mitigate customer churn.

##### ➼ Churn Rate :
The churn rate, which indicates the percentage of customers who stopped using the service during a certain time period, seems to be a significant factor. It would be helpful to analyze the churn rate to understand why customers are leaving and take appropriate actions to reduce it.

##### ➼ Demographic Analysis :

• 𝐆𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐞𝐫 𝐃𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐢𝐛𝐮𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 :

This section displays the count of customers based on their gender, categorized as male and female.

• 𝐓𝐞𝐧𝐮𝐫𝐞 :

The tenure of customers varies widely, ranging from 1 to 72 months. This suggests that the service has both new and long-standing customers.

• 𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐫𝐧𝐞𝐭 𝐒𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐜𝐞 :

Fiber optic appears to be the most popular internet service among customers, followed by DSL.

• 𝐎𝐧𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐞 𝐒𝐞𝐜𝐮𝐫𝐢𝐭𝐲 & 𝐓𝐞𝐜𝐡 𝐒𝐮𝐩𝐩𝐨𝐫𝐭 :

Customers who have subscribed to online security and tech support services have a lower churn rate as they value security and assistance.

•𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐜𝐭 𝐓𝐲𝐩𝐞 :

Customers with longer contract durations (e.g., one year or two years) is less likely to churn compared to those on a month-to-month contract.

##### ➼ Billing & Payment :

• 𝐏𝐚𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐥𝐞𝐬𝐬 𝐁𝐢𝐥𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐠 :

Customers who opt for paperless billing may have different behavior compared to those who receive paper bills.

• 𝐏𝐚𝐲𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐌𝐞𝐭𝐡𝐨𝐝 :

The choice of payment method (e.g., electronic check, credit card, bank transfer) might influence customer loyalty and churn rate.

• 𝐌𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐡𝐥𝐲 𝐂𝐡𝐚𝐫𝐠𝐞𝐬 :

Monthly charges vary across customers, with some paying as low as $20 and others paying over $100. Understanding the reasons behind these differences can help in pricing strategies and  customer retention efforts.

### Define proper KPIs:

» This task requires to define the appropriate KPIs for the retention manager based on the dataset.
Create a dashboard for the retention manager reflecting the KPIs:

» This task require to create a dashboard that displays the defined KPIs for the retention manager to track the customer retention rate.
Write a short email to him (the engagement partner) explaining your findings, and include suggestions as to what needs to be changed:

»This task requires to write an email to the engagement partner, explaining the findings from the dashboard and providing suggestions on what needs to be changed to improve customer retention.

## ✨ 𝐓𝐚𝐬𝐤 𝟑 : Diversity & Inclusion Dashboard

►  As a part of the PwC Switzerland Virtual Internship Program offered by Forage, I have developed a "𝐃𝐢𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐢𝐭𝐲 & 𝐈𝐧𝐜𝐥𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧" Dashboard using Power BI.

► Telecom client partners with PwC Switzerland to boost executive gender balance through diversity and inclusion.

► The task involves developing key performance indicators (KPIs) related to hiring, promotion, performance, and turnover, along with creating a visualization to track and communicate progress.

► Goal: A valued and inclusive environment for all teams.

✤ During the project below is the points cover in dashboard :-

1] No. of Employee

2] No. of Men Employee

3] No. of Female Employee

4] Hired Employees Men vs Female.

5] Employees Promoted (FY20) & (FY21)

6] Male Employees Promoted (FY20) & (FY21)

7] Female Employees Promoted (FY20) & (FY21)

8] Turnover

9] Average Performance Rating Men

10] Average Performance Rating Women

### ➡️  Key Performance Indicators ( KPI'S) : 

➤ 𝐇𝐢𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠: 

By tracking % of hires Men vs. Women, we gain visibility into recruitment practices, ensuring a balanced workforce from the outset.

➤ 𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐦𝐨𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 :

 Measuring % of promotions- Men vs. Women, identifying and celebrating talent, ensuring opportunities are equitable and merit-based.

➤ 𝐏𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞 :

Assessing average performance ratings - Men vs. Women, pinpoint potential biases and create a fair evaluation system.

➤ 𝐓𝐮𝐫𝐧𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐫 :

Monitoring % turnover - Men vs. Women, identify areas of concern, ensuring our workplace retains diverse talent.

» The final goal is the practical approach to address gender balance challenges in the workplace. The goal is not only to set strategic objectives but also to measure, analyze, and continuously improve diversity and inclusion initiatives.
